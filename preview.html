# EBenezer

This document describes HTTP API of the *Employee Benefits Portal* application.

## Required headers

All requests described in this document *must* contain the following headers:

- &#96;Authorization: Bearer &lt;ebToken&gt;&#96;, where &#96;ebToken&#96; is the token received from
the single-sign-on SAML service.

These headers will not repeated in the specific endpoints.

## Group Top Level Entities

All top level entities have a revision number associated with them,
starting from &#96;0&#96; when first created. This number is always available
through the response header &#96;ETag&#96;.

All &#96;GET&#96; requests must include header &#96;Accept: application/json&#96;, and when
a certain revision is expected (e.g. after an update), should include header
&#96;If-Match: W/&quot;2&quot;&#96;, where &#96;2&#96; represents the expected/minimum revision. This
handles any potential _eventual consistency_ race conditions in a transparent
manner.

Alternatively, and preferably, any &#96;GET&#96; URL can be accessed in Javascript
through the
[EventSource API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventSource),
which will stream the current revision and any subsequent updates.
